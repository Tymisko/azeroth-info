                <p>Born in AD 30, Lord Uther the Lightbringer was the first Silverhand paladin to lead his order against the Horde during the Second War. During the Third War, Uther was betrayed by his beloved student, Prince Arthas. The blade of frost piercing his chest ended his existence by binding his souls with dark runes from the shadowlands, but the light preserved his souls, or rather a part of it, which ended up in the bastion of the place where all the souls serving the light were sent, and was supposed to get rid of the memories there to turn into a rope capturing the souls of the fallen. As an arcane, he was not to judge and not lynch himself because it was not his competence. Devos, the commander-in-chief of the arcana, helped him achieve his goal, but the soul of the Uther was broken, he still felt the cold touch of the blade and the betrayal committed by his ward. Devos, after seeing what Arthas did to Uther, wanted justice and punish Arthas by bringing him into the abyss, but her sovereignty firmly forbade her to do so because even Arthas deserved a fair trial. Devos carried by anger gave Uther the power of the exalted, the power of the arcana when Artchas died they took over his souls and Uther threw him into the abyss desiring justice. What happened to the honor of the soul caught by the blade or Arthas deserved the abyss, we will soon find out.</p>

                <h3>Anduin In His War Armor</h3>
                <img src="../img/pages/style/WoW_Battle_for_Azeroth_Greymane_and_Anduin.jpg" alt="Anduin and Greymane">
                <p>Anduin Llane Wrynn is the King of Stormwind, High King of the Alliance, and commander of all Alliance forces since the death of his father, Varian Wrynn. </p>
                <p>
                    After the abduction of King Varian when Anduin was just a boy, he was named King of Stormwind under the regency of Bolvar Fordragon and the advise of Lady Katrana Prestor. In truth, however, Katrana Prestor was a disguise for the black dragon Onyxia, who had used her dark magic to split Varian in two. When one half of Varian returned to the throne of Stormwind, Anduin was the first to sense something amiss with the man claiming to be his father. Before long, the other half of Varian returned to Stormwind and unmasked Lady Prestor for what she truly was, but in response, Onyxia kidnapped Anduin and brought him to her lair across the sea. Despite the two Varians' differences, their shared love for Anduin allowed them to work together to slay Onyxia and save their son from the dragon's clutches; in the process, Onyxia inadvertently fused Varian's two halves back into a single man.
